      A flexible, scalable, and browser-based data analysis environment for
      reproducible neuroimaging
  description: >-
      NeuroDesk was a project proposed at the 2020 Australian chapter of the OHBM hackathon,
      which has grown into a fully-fledged data analysis environment and is powering the
      Australian Electrophysiology Data Analytics PlaTform (AEDAPT) project funded by
      the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

      Generating music from brain signal data using deep learning
  description: >-
      Brainharmonic was a project proposed at the 2021 BrainHack Australasia virtual
      hackathon. This project developed a tool to generate music from brain signals using
      deep learning models using deep AI models from EEG/fMRI signal.

      BIDSify your animal electrophysiology data
  description: >-
      Proposed as a project at the 2021 BrainHack Global Marseille event, BIDS-ephys is
      an extension proposal so that BIDS (a standardized data structure described here)
      can support electrophysiological data recorded in animal models.
